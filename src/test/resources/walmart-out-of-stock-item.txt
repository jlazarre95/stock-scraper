Worth the hype!
I've had every PlayStation since the PS2, and this new console hands down is the best one yet! Has so many cool features, graphics, and is buttery smooth. No more slow UI with lag like the PS3/PS4. Such an awesome console with allot of potential. And it doesn't sound like a jet engine!!

I sold my PS4 a while back and I've been without a console since then. This thing is a BEAST. Installs games super quick (I did 5 in a 30min timeframe), loads fast, fantastic visuals, and the new effects built into the controller are super immersive!

Very nice upgrade over the PS4. The xmb is user friendly and very smooth. The graphics are fantastic. The system is noticeably much quicker. Setup was super easy. I love this system. Thanks to Walmart for coming through as well. I ordered both systems with zero issues and both were delivered on launch day.

Wouldve liked a little more transparency about the shipping, but was very surprised when it showed up on time. Just finished Astros Playroom. Sony paid an incredible amount of attention to detail. The X Box may be a little more powerful, but PS5 is going to provide the better experience and immersion in its games. Paired with the Pulse 3D headset, it really helps pull you in.

18. This is the disc version. If you look at the second, third, or fourth photo you can see to the left of the controller that there is a skinny black slot and that's where the discs go. If it doesn't have that then it isn't the disc version. Hope I helped.

12. What is wrong is that Walmart’s website is so bad that they want to fill up their whole server and have it crash and for the people who get here first don’t get it they just pick and choose who gets it and it doesn’t load even when your in the place order section.

13. The reason is because Walmart and other retailers refuse to combat the growing problem of opportunistic re-sellers using BOTS to purchase the inventory as it becomes available to try and sell on eBay for triple the retail price. It's also the fault of parents who can't say NO to their kids that created this chaos but everyone on here can put a stop to it by never paying more than retail price for an object. Let the re-sellers feel the pain and have to sell their item without making a profit.
