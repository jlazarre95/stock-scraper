It's a really good game but it crashes to much I was just two hours in and I had it crash when I was in a cutscene but I didn't think much of it so I started it again and five minutes later it crashed again and again

Disappointed... Let Down...
October 1, 2020
Wow... I was looking forward to the remaster of the original game, then insomniac decided to swap Peter Parker's face... to make it (fit Yuri Lowenthal's voice) but it just looks like a 13 year old tom Holland, even miles looks older than him. Tbh I don't even see a big difference either, they just added mirroring and shadows, but the PS4 Pro's enhancements are fine on their own, I only recommend getting this if you are a collector of some sort. But if you wanna purchase the remaster after individually, GET THE PS4 VERSION, it has a free ps5 upgrade and a option to buy the remaster.
